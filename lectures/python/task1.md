## Pascal's Triangle to 8th row

### Task No. 1

You may have heard of pascal's triangle before. It looks something basically like this:

```
         1
       1   1
     1   2   1
   1   3   3   1
 1   4   6   4   1
```

Your first task is very simple. Print the Pascal's triangle using 8 print functions, so that they are displayed neatly and evenly spaced!

This task is due by the end of the week 1 (Jan 24th 2020).

You can score up to 8 points with this.
