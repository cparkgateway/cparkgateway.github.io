# Portfolio

Portfolio is a set of creative works.

The + α means that any overflow grade from this criteria will boost your other parts if needed.

## Tech Skills Criteria (30%)

One should try to satisfy most, but not necessarily all criteria.

1. Should display usage of brushes, pencils.
1. Use of color palette and transparency.
1. Ability to easily replicate similar pictures.
1. Cropping and editing existing images.
1. Any other thing you might have learned in class.

## Art/Design Skills Criteria (50% + α)

1. Coherent Theme and Consistency - 10% (Choose a theme, and stick to it.)
1. Adheres to Pixel Art Style if applicable - 10% (Don't give me copy pasted meme from the internet. However, if you think you are confident enough with any other art style, go ahead.)
1. Wide Selection of Diverse Works - 10% + α (Don't just give me 2 or 3 32x32 pixel pictures and call it a day.)
1. Creativity - 20% + α (Don't give me similar terrain tile over and over again.)

## Effort (20% + α)

If I see you guys just playing shellshockers or browsing the internet during in-class work time, you will most likely not score high from this criterion.

"I don't know what to do" is not a valid excuse, because you can always ask me for something to or think about. It's also not like you are not allowed to talk to people next to you during class for additional ideas or inspiraations. **You can use your peer's theme if you are really that stuck, it's ok since just because the theme is same, two of you will not produce same set of works.**

Also, don't copy things from the web, it's really not that hard for me to figure out that you did. *If you mention beforehand that you traced an artwork as practice then THAT is ok.*
